Linkhive Search v0.1 by Andree Chea

Linkhive Search is a C++/Qt program to search through tables in MySQL/SQLite databases.

Software requirements
=====================
A minimum of Qt 4.4, and its development environment.

Setup
=====
There currently isn't an install system, so the code needs to be compiled manually.

Run 'qmake' to generate a Makefile from linkhive.pro, then 'make' to build the program with make, then './linkhive' to run it.  Some debugging is enabled; to disable it, remove the debug keyword from the CONFIG environment variable in linkhive.pro, then run 'qmake' again.  The main case where it'll be a problem is if you type a table name that you haven't configured yet.  Otherwise, it should be fine to leave it in.

Linkhive Search needs to know the databases available.  Though there is a menu option, you currently can't use it to add new configs; they must be created by hand.  Create a file Linkhive.ini with the following (assuming you used the fetcher's database/table defaults):

[tables]
reddit_stories=0
hn_stories=0

[configs]
size=1
1\host=
1\user=
1\pass=
1\db=linkhive
1\type=sqlite

and save it in one of the following places (case-sensitive):

Linux/OSX:
$HOME/.config/Linkhive.ini

Windows:
%APPDATA%\Linkhive.ini

From the QSettings documentation ( http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qsettings.html#platform-specific-notes ), "the %APPDATA% path is usually C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data".

Since Linkhive Search is a generic MySQL search program, it can search through any database.  So if you have a different database with links, like for example those from del.icio.us saved with MySQLicious ( http://code.google.com/p/mysqlicious/ ), you can add it to Linkhive.ini and Linkhive Search will accept it.  The new Linkhive.ini might then look something like this:

[tables]
reddit_stories=0
hn_stories=0
delicious=1

[configs]
size=2
1\host=
1\user=
1\pass=
1\db=linkhive
1\type=sqlite
2\host=localhost
2\user=yourdeliciousmysqluserhere
2\pass=yourdeliciousmysqlpasshere
2\db=delicious
2\type=mysql

Usage
=====
There are two main sections of the program.  The left sidebar is where you type in a query, and the right is where the results of the query are shown.  

Keyboard shortcuts
* Ctrl+T for new tab
* Ctrl+W to close tab
* Ctrl+Tab to select tab to right
* Ctrl+Shift+Tab to select tab to left

URLs are underlined and you can click them with your mouse or press enter to open it in the default browser.

Nothing in the Settings dialog works for saving at the moment, only viewing.

Future
======
Though this is my first Qt app, I'm not sure if a desktop app is the best for searching, and soon, categorizing.  For one, it requires Qt to be installed.  One benefit of making this web-based is that the URLs can be marked visited by the browser history.  In any case, this program will most likely be scrapped and rewritten.
